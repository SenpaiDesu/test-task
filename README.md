## What to be done
A page that displays Properties for rent, based on the Type. Properties are stored on server, and customer selects the region from a dropdown. We need to see the list of results:
- Title
- Image
- Desc
- Price
- Delta with Avg.Price

Avg.Price is average price for search results dataset.

Please see a mockup of search bar in the attached files. Feel free to style results in line with page design. ALternatively you may use self-made components from your past experience.
